 This project shows my skills in Excel and SQL

### Project Overview

This is my first personal project, created to showcase the skills I have gained through self-study. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from GitHub. For this project, I utilized Excel to perform basic calculations, apply functions for analysis, data cleaning, and create data visualizations. Additionally, I used SQL to conduct an in-depth analysis of bike sales.

**The goal of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of:**

- Gender-based purchasing trends.
- Bike purchase behaviors by marital status.
- Geographic distribution of bike sales.
- The impact of income levels on bike purchases.
- The influence of having children on purchasing decisions.
- Bike sales trends based on commute distance.
- The relationship between education levels and bike purchases.
- Occupation-specific purchasing patterns.

**Problem Statement**

1. What are the key demographic and behavioral factors influencing bike purchase decisions?
2. How do income levels and geographic regions impact bike sales trends?
3. Do commute distances and family structures affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
4. What roles do education and occupation play in shaping bike purchasing behavior?
5. How can businesses leverage these insights to develop targeted marketing strategies and product offerings?

### Tools and Their Applications

Excel: Use for Basic Analysis, Data Cleaning, PIVOT Table, and Data Visualization

MySQL Workbench: Data Cleaning, and Explanatory Data Analysis

ChatGPT: For Improving Sentences and getting better suggestions and recommendations

**Excel Data Cleaning**

After Downloading the Dataset from GitHub I started by duplicating the file and starting data cleaning this included:

- Removing Duplicates
- Standardize Data
- Removing Blank and Null data
- Removing Unnecessary Data
